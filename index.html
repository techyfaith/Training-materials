        <p> I enjoy watching sports a lot. The excitement, adrenalin and passion associated with most sports make the experience or feeling of watching indescribable. It is little wonder why sports of any kind is a money making venture. Simply put, people want to be happy and sports give people joy. So people are willing to spend money in order to experience that joy over and over again! <br> </p>
