     <p> I enjoy watching sports a lot. The excitement, adrenalin and passion associated with most sports make the experience or feeling of watching indescribable. It is little wonder why sports of any kind is a money making venture. <br>Simply put, people want to be happy and sports give people joy. So people are willing to spend money in order to experience that joy over and over again! </p>
